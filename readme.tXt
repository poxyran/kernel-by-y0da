Kernel
~~~~~~

This is a small example of how to get the ImageBase of
Kernel32.dll and how to get addresses of the kernel's
LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress functions without any APIs !

I tested this code on Win98SE and Win2k.

For any comments or bugreports trop a line to yoda_f2f@gmx.net.

HAppy New Year !
